# Clicky Pokemon Game App
# Pokemon - Gotta "Click" Them All

## Description

* This project was bootstrapped with Create Reacr App: [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* The application renders 12 different Pokemon card images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

* The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

* Every time an image is clicked, the Pokemon card images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

* The highest score the user can receive is 12 points. If the user's score reaches 12 points, a congrats message appears and the game restarts.
